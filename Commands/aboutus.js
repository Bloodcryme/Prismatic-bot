Our mechanics for starting new players and setting up skill levelling will be explained in more detail below. Additionally, we aspire to create the best Prismata guild to ever exist.\n\nAfter a few years we hope to expand our operations outside of North America to support players in Europe and perhaps eventually in Asia```");
